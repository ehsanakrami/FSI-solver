# FSI-solver
Monolithic 3D solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction written in Matlab and C++ (using Eigen and Spectra). 
The equations are solved in time using a Newmark scheme, during which the nonlinear equations of Large Deformations Elasticity and Fluid Dynamics are solved using an arc-length method.

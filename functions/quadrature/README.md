# Numerical integration schemes with Gauss quadrature rule

Gauss points and weights are provided for block elements, with a choice between:
- 8 integration points, for 8-node blocks;
- 27 integration points, for 20-node blocks;
- 1 integration point, not recommended since no proper reduced integration procedure is implemented.
